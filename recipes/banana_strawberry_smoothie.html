<h1>Banana Strawberry Smoothie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I hate bananas. Can't get over their texture. However I am a marathon runner, and everything I read about nutrition speaks of their benefits. So I've chosen to blend them up in smoothies instead of eating them straight-up.</p>
    <p>Strawberries are great for you too. Everyone should get at least two servings of berries each day, and this should cover both. You can also add in a half cup of spinach, and it just disappears right in. Boom, there's your daily serving of spinach bitch. Didn't even notice it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Blender</li>
        <li>1 banana (unfrozen)</li>
        <li>1 cup of frozen strawberries</li>
        <li>1 cup of almond milk (with more at the ready)</li>
        <li>0.5 cup frozen spinach</li>
        <li>(optional) A big scoop of peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour in almond milk.</li>
        <li>Peel banana and break into chunks. Drop em in your blender.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of your ingredients</li>
        <li>Pulse it a few times to get a rhythm going, then blend those fucking sons of bitches</li>
        <li>Pour in a cup with a straw and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
