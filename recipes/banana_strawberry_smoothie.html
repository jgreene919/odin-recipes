    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I fucking hate bananas. Can't get over their texture. However I am a vegan marathon runner, and everything I read about nutrition speaks of their benefits. So I've chosen to blend them up in smoothies instead of eating them straight-up.</p>
    <p>Strawberries are great for you too. Everyone should get at least two servings of berries each day, and this should cover both. You can also add in a half cup of spinach, and it just disappears right in. Boom, there's your daily serving of spinach bitch. Didn't even notice it.</p>
    <p>I recommend using frozen strawberries and unfrozen bananas. If both are frozen the smoothie becomes too thick.</p>
    <li>
        <ul>Blender</ul>
        <ul>1 banana (unfrozen)</ul>
        <ul>1 cup of frozen strawberries</ul>
        <ul>1 cup of almond milk (with more at the ready)</ul>
        <ul>0.5 cup frozen spinach</ul>
        <ul>(optional) A big scoop of peanut butter</ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <ol>Pour in almond milk.</ol>
        <ol>Peel banana and break into chunks. Drop em in your blender.</ol>
        <ol>Add the rest of your ingredients</ol>
        <ol>Pulse it a few times to get a rhythm going, then blend those fucking sons of bitches</ol>
        <ol>Pour in a cup with a straw and enjoy!</ol>
    </li>
